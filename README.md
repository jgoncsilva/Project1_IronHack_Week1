### Project: Escape Room Python Game
#### Overview
The goal of this project is for you to apply the Python programming skills you have learned this week in solving a real problem. We present you the design of a classic game that can be played via text - Escape Room. Your goal is to develop the game using Python based on the game design.

Read the game narratives and technical requirements carefully. Plan how you will achieve your goal with pseudo codes and/or flowchart. Review the logic and process in order to avoid potential errors. Then implement with Python code. After that, test your code several times with different inputs and make sure it's rock solid. The instructional team is standing by to help you in case you run into any problems.

The project was designed to develop skills to create functions, use datatypes and operators, and other skills that were learned in the IronHack Data Analysis bootcamp.
