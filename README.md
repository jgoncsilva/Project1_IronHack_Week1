## PROJECT RESUME 

### Game Design
The game design is simple as it runs on the terminal. However, we made sure to add Morse code, and a figure made by symbols (eg |, \, -) to be displayed during the game experience, which in our opinion should not (in this case) escape from the same screen, as it is a game that needs concentration to be completed as quickly as possible.

### Game Narratives
  The narratives of this project have been enhanced with descriptions for the objects to make interaction with the user better.
  The code verified the quality of the information available at the beginning of the game.
  The phrases used (with humor) were intended to make the experience more fun, since the essence of the game is to be trapped and unable to escape, so we seek to make the process of leaving funnie.
  #### You can find the new dictionary with new objects in general [here](https://github.com/jgoncsilva/Project1_IronHack_Week1/blob/master/Final-Project/dictionaries.py)
  
### Game Room
  The room has been improved with new objects including an animal, a safe with a password that requires deduction and reading of Morse code, trap door and a bookcase.

### Project: Escape Room Python Game
#### Overview
The goal of this project is for you to apply the Python programming skills you have learned this week in solving a real problem. We present you the design of a classic game that can be played via text - Escape Room. Your goal is to develop the game using Python based on the game design.

Read the game narratives and technical requirements carefully. Plan how you will achieve your goal with pseudo codes and/or flowchart. Review the logic and process in order to avoid potential errors. Then implement with Python code. After that, test your code several times with different inputs and make sure it's rock solid. The instructional team is standing by to help you in case you run into any problems.

The project was designed to develop skills to create functions, use datatypes and operators, and other skills that were learned in the IronHack Data Analysis bootcamp.

####  Technical Requirements

* Use Python lists and dictionaries to define the rooms, items, and relations of them.

* Use a Python dictionary to store the game state. Update the state dictionary when progresses are made such as a key is collected.

* Use Python functions to play the game. Don't use procedural code.

* After completing each game action, call the next function to continue playing until the winning condition is reached.

* The winning condition is for the player to successfully make to the "Outside" room. When this happens, congrat the player and end the game.

#### Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo.

* `main.ipynb` that contains your solution.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

1. Start Jupyter Notebook from this lab directory.

1. Launch `sample-code.ipynb` and read through the file. Also execute the code and play the game. Make sure you understand what each line of the codes does.

1. Create `main.ipynb` and copy the codes from `sample-code.ipynb`. Expand the code following the example to create Bedroom 1.

1. Test the game with Game Room and Bedroom 1. Make sure everything works then work on Bedroom 2 then Living Room.

1. Test the whole game. Try to make all kinds of inputs to make sure your game is rock solid and will not break.
